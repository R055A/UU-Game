class Peer:
    """
    A class which acts as a either a server or client.
    Only serves to send of receive data.
    Only difference between server and client is that server is set up to\
    accept a connection from the client.

    Attributes
    ----------
    HOST : string
        String containing the IP address intended to connect with. '127.0.0.1' is\
        loop back interface
    PORT : int
        Port number used to connect
    BUFSIZ : int
        Maximum number of bytes allowed to send over socket
    CONNECTION : socket
        socket housing remote connection, used to send data
    ACCEPT_SOCKET : socket
        socket used by server in order to accept connection from client
    SERVER : Bool
        Boolean to determine whether peer is acting as client of server

    Methods
    -------
    accept_client(self)
        Method to accept client as server
    connect_to_server(self)
        Method to connect to server as client
    send(self, data)
        method to send data over connection
    receive(self)
        method to receive data over connection

        method to close sockets when peer is no longer needed
